#summary An example representing how to use lncRScan

= Introduction =

This is an example representing how to use lncRScan to detect novel lncRNAs

= Input =
high-confident.gtf -- a GTF file recording high-confident transcripts with classcodes

lnc_class -- a list of classcodes, which may contain lncRNAs

= Steps =

 * extract_category -- extract 3121 transcripts from input GTF file according to the classcodes listed.

   (1) $ extract_GTF_class.pl high-confident.gtf lnc_class (extracted.gtf and extracted_id are generated)

   (2) $ mv extracted.gtf transcripts_1.gtf

 * extract_length -- extract transcripts from transcripts_1.gtf according to length >=200nt

   (1) Get transcripts_1.bed according to transcripts_1.gtf using UCSC table browser

   (2) extract 3094 multi-exon transcript with length >=200nt
       $ extract_long_multi.pl transcripts_1.bed > transcripts_2.bed

   (3) get transcripts_2.fa according to transcripts_2.bed

 * extract_ORF --
